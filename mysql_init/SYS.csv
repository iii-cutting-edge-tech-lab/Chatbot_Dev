"100","A startup company hired you to help them build a mobile application, that will ultimately store billions of images and videos in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). The company is lean on funding, and wants to minimize operational costs, however, they have an aggressive marketing plan, and expect to double their current installation base every six months. Due to the nature of their business, they are expecting sudden and large increases in traffic to and from S3, and need to ensure that it can handle the performance needs of their application.?? What other information must you gather from this customer in order to determine whether S3 is the right option?
","(A)You must know how many customers the company has today, because this is critical in understanding what their customer base will be in two years.","(B)You must find out the total number of requests per second at peak usage.","(C)You must know the size of the individual objects being written to S3, in order to properly
design the key namespace.","(D)In order to build the key namespace correctly, you must understand the total amount of
storage needs for each S3 bucket.","D","You must find out the total number of requests per second at peak usage.

This is because the S3 api does have limits on the requests per second.

""This topic discusses Amazon S3 best practices for optimizing performance depending on your request rates. If your workload in an Amazon S3 bucket routinely exceeds 100 PUT/LIST/DELETE requests per second or more than 300 GET requests per second, follow the guidelines in this topic to ensure the best performance and scalability.""","http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
